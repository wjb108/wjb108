### Hi there 👋

I'm an analytical, entrepreneurial, and structured thinker with varied work experience in operating companies, financial institutions, and startups in roles spanning product, financial analysis, and business development. I have worked in the US, Europe, and Latin America and speak English, Spanish, and Italian fluently.

I completed General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive 12 week program and built basic web apps with real-world applications such as
🧳 [Bazar App](https://github.com/wjb108/Bazar), 🥡 [Taco Order System](https://github.com/wjb108/Taco-Order-System), and 📍 [Render a Dynamic Map](https://github.com/wjb108/Mapbox-Dynamic-Map-API).

<!--- 
My focus has been on building digital services for emerging markets, in particular Mexico.
