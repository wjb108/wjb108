### Hi there 👋

I'm a trilingual software engineer and fintech aficionado with a strong interest in building digital services that create social impact. I am a detail-oriented analytical person with a background in credit research, equity markets, and oil & gas and mining sectors. 

<!--- 
My focus has been on building digital services for emerging markets, in particular Mexico.
--->
I'm looking for full or part-time role as a software engineer at a mission driven company that fully embraces remote work. 

I have two weeks left as a full-time fellow in General Asembly's Software Engineering Immersive program, that has taught me how to build full-stack web applications with the MongoDB, Express, React, Node stack.
