### Hi there 👋

I'm a trilingual software engineer and fintech aficionado with a strong interest in building digital services that create social impact.

<!--- 
My focus has been on building digital services for emerging markets, in particular Mexico.

I bring my love of learning, grit, and international experience to the table, leveraging my background in research analytics in credit research, equity markets, and project financing. More recently, I co-founded a boutique design agency and am in the process of building two early stage startups. Seeing the evolution of app development for these projects really inspired me and was the impetus to go back to school, so I too could contribute in developing applications that can have a social impact.

Before I knew it, General Asembly's Software Engineering Immersive 12 week program was over in a flash. I built web apps with real-world applications such as
📍 [Render a Dynamic Map](https://github.com/wjb108/Mapbox-Dynamic-Map-API), 🥡 [Taco Order System](https://github.com/wjb108/Taco-Order-System), and 🧳 [Bazar App](https://github.com/wjb108/Bazar). I know I have found my calling in development, a great balance of math, logic, and creativity. 

I am proud to have mastered two foreign languages Spanish and Italian and have a track record of rapidly learning new languges that with my dedication and consistency evolve into mastery. To quote, the former Italian managing director of the oil company I worked for, “On his arrival to Italy, he was incredibly fluent in Italian, difficult to believe he achieved that level in only three months of self-studying.” 

Development has many similar attributes to learning spoken languages such as pattern recognition, syntax/grammar, new vocabulary, trial and error, and constant learning over the years. I am a motivated and capable learner that looks forward to learning and personal growth as a developer.

I look forward to discussing this opportunity further. 
 
Thank you for your time and consideration.


Will
