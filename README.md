### Hi there 👋

I'm a trilingual software engineer and fintech aficionado with a strong interest in building digital services that create social impact.

<!--- 
My focus has been on building digital services for emerging markets, in particular Mexico.

I bring my love of learning, grit, and international experience to the table, leveraging my background in research analytics in credit research, equity markets, and project financing. More recently, I co-founded a boutique design agency 🖌️ [Flekora](https://weareflekora.com/) and am in the process of building two early stage startups: 🛍️ [Localsumer](https://www.localsumer.com/) and 💳 [Lanissimo](https://lanissimo.com/). Seeing the evolution of the app development for these projects really inspired me and was the impetus to go back to school, so I too could contribute in developing applications that can have a social impact.

Before I knew it, General Asembly's Software Engineering Immersive 12 week program was over in a flash. I built web apps with real-world applications such as
🧳 [Bazar App](https://github.com/wjb108/Bazar), 🥡 [Taco Order System](https://github.com/wjb108/Taco-Order-System), and 📍 [Render a Dynamic Map](https://github.com/wjb108/Mapbox-Dynamic-Map-API). I know I have found my calling in development, a great balance of math, logic, and creativity. 

I am proud to have mastered two foreign languages Spanish and Italian and have a track record of rapidly learning new languges that with my dedication and consistency evolve into mastery. To quote, the former Italian managing director of the oil company I worked for, “On his arrival to Italy, he was incredibly fluent in Italian, difficult to believe he achieved that level in only three months of self-studying.” 

Development has many similar attributes to learning spoken languages such as pattern recognition, syntax/grammar, new vocabulary, trial and error, and constant learning over the years. I am a motivated and capable learner that looks forward to learning and personal growth.
 
Thank you for your time and consideration.

Will
